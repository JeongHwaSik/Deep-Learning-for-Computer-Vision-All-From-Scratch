# A2. Linear Classifier

## A2-1. Single Layer Linear Neural Network
A single-layer neural network is trained from scratch on the CIFAR-10 dataset for image classification.
Here, I avoided using `nn.Linear.forward()` and `loss.backward()`. 
Instead, I implemented the forward pass of the linear layer and the backward pass (manually calculating gradients using the chain rule) entirely from scratch‚ùóÔ∏è
Two different loss functions, SVM loss and SoftMax loss, are used to compare their performance and they are also implemented from the bottom without using PyTorch modules.
SVM classifier achieves **38.99%** for validation set while SoftMax classifier achieves **39.69%**.
The figure below visualizes a learned weights of the linear layer. As you can see, the weights attempt to mimic the original object but a little bit blurry.

## A2-2. Two Layer Linear Neural Network
A two layer linear neural network is trained from scratch on the CIFAR-10 dataset for image classification.
As I mentioned in A2-1, I implemented the forward and backward passes of two linear layers all from scratch without using `nn.Linear.forward()` and `loss.backward()`‚ùóÔ∏è
Experiments were conducted with neural networks using different hyper-parameters (hidden dimension for below-left figure, regularization term for upper-right figure, learning rate for upper-left figure) and found out that the optimal validation performance of **52.32%** was achieved!

After then, I visualized the weights of the first linear layer (W1) both before and after training. Refer to the figure below. 
Similar to the learned weights figure in A2-1, the weights here also attempt to mimic the original object but with greater clarity.
