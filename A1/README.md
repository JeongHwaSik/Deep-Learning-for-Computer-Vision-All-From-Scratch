# A1. K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) Classifier
The K-NN algorithm was used to train the CIFAR-10 dataset from scratch for image classification.
Cross-validation was performed to find the optimal hyperparameters, and testing was conducted. 
As a result, a top-1 accuracy of **33.86%** was achieved for K-NN classifier with k=10.

The figure on the left illustrates how to select the optimal hyperparameter k using cross-validation, while the figure on the right demonstrates how the K-NN algorithm operates when k = 5; a similar process applies to other values of k.
