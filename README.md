## üê£ A1. [K-Nearest Neighbor](https://github.com/JeongHwaSik/Deep-Learning-for-Computer-Vision-All-From-Scratch/blob/main/A1/knn.ipynb)
 The K-NN algorithm was used to train the CIFAR-10 dataset from scratch for image classification. Cross-validation was performed to find the optimal hyperparameters, and testing was conducted. As a result, a top-1 accuracy of **33.86%** was achieved.

## üê¶ A2. Linear Classifier

### A2-1. [Linear Classifiers](https://github.com/JeongHwaSik/Deep-Learning-for-Computer-Vision-All-From-Scratch/blob/main/A2/linear_classifier.ipynb)
 A single-layer neural network is trained from scratch on the CIFAR-10 dataset for image classification. Two different loss functions, SVM loss and SoftMax loss, are used to compare their performance. SVM classifier achieves 9.06% for validation set while SoftMax classifier achieves **39.69%**.

### A2-2. [Two Layer Neural Network](https://github.com/JeongHwaSik/Deep-Learning-for-Computer-Vision-All-From-Scratch/blob/main/A2/two_layer_net.ipynb)
 A two layer neural network is trained from scratch on the CIFAR-10 dataset for image classification. Experiments were conducted with neural networks using different hyper-parameters (hidden dimension, regularization term, learning rate) and found out that the optimal validation performance of **52.32%** was achieved!
