# Deep Learning for Computer Vision üî•All From Scratchüî•

## Notice
Big thanks to Michigan Online and Justin Johnson for creating and sharing the fantastic [Deep Learning for Computer Vision (EECS598)](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~justincj/teaching/eecs498/WI2022/) course online! This repository is fully licensed under EECS598.

## [üê£ A1. K-Nearest Neighbor](https://github.com/JeongHwaSik/Deep-Learning-for-Computer-Vision-All-From-Scratch/blob/main/A1/knn.ipynb)
 The K-NN algorithm was used to train the CIFAR-10 dataset from scratch for image classification. Cross-validation was performed to find the optimal hyperparameters, and testing was conducted. As a result, a top-1 accuracy of **33.86%** was achieved.
